    <h3>
        SCENE-the same scene as in Act I with the exception that in place
      of the ruins that filled the foreground of the stage, the
      interior of a magnificent temple is seen showing the background
      of the scene of Act I, through the columns of the portico at the
      back. High throne. L.U.E. Low seats below it.  All the substitute
      gods and goddesses [that is to say, Thespians] are discovered
      grouped in picturesque attitudes about the stage, eating and
      drinking, and smoking and singing the following verses.

         Of all symposia
           The best by half
           Upon Olympus, here await us.
           We eat ambrosia.
           And nectar quaff,
           It cheers but don't inebriate us.
           We know the fallacies,
           Of human food
           So please to pass Olympian rosy,
           We built up palaces,
           Where ruins stood,
           And find them much more snug and cosy.</div>
         
    
      <h4 class="name">SILL.</h4> 
           
           To work and think, my dear,
           Up here would be,
           The height of conscientious folly.
           So eat and drink, my dear,
           I like to see,
           Young people gay—young people jolly.
           Olympian food my love,
           I'll lay long odds,
           Will please your lips—those rosy portals,
           What is the good, my love
           Of being gods,
           If we must work like common mortals?
         
    
     <h4>CHO.</h4> 
    Of all symposia...etc.
    
      <p class= "direction"> [Exeunt all but Nicemis, who is dressed as Diana and Pretteia,
      who is dressed as Venus. They take Sillimon's arm and bring him
      down]</p>
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> 
    Bless their little hearts, I can refuse them nothing. As
      the Olympian stage-manager I ought to be strict with them and
      make them do their duty, but i can't.  Bless their little hearts,
      when I see the pretty little craft come sailing up to me with a
      wheedling smile on their pretty little figure-heads, I can't turn
      my back on 'em.  I'm all bow, though I'm sure I try to be stern.
    
      <h4 class="name">PRET.</h4> 
    You certainly are a dear old thing.
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> 
    She says I'm a dear old thing.  Deputy Venus says I'm a
      dear old thing.
    
      <h4>NICE.</h4> 
    It's her affectionate habit to describe everybody in those
      terms. I am more particular, but still even I am bound to admit
      that you are certainly a very dear old thing.
    
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4>
    Deputy Venus says I'm a dear old thing, and Deputy Diana
      who is much more particular, endorses it. Who could be severe
      with such deputy divinities.
    
    
      <h4>PRET.</h4> Do you know, I'm going to ask you a favour.
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> Venus is going to ask me a favour.
    
      <h4>PRET.</h4> You see, I am Venus.
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> No one who saw your face would doubt it.
    
      <h4>NICE.</h4> <p>[aside]</p> No one who knew her character would.
    
      <h4>PRET.</h4> Well Venus, you know, is married to Mars.
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> To Vulcan, my dear, to Vulcan. The exact connubial relation
      of the different gods and goddesses is a point on which we must
      be extremely particular.
    
      <h4>PRET.</h4> I beg your pardon—Venus is married to Mars.
    
      <h4>NICE.</h4> If she isn't married to Mars, she ought to be.
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> Then that decides it—call it married to Mars.
    
      <h4>PRET.</h4> Married to Vulcan or married to Mars, what does it signify?
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> My dear, it's a matter on which I have no personal feeling
      whatever.
    
      <h4>PRET.</h4> So that she is married to someone.
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> Exactly. So that she is married to someone. Call it married
      to Mars.
    
      <h4>PRET.</h4> Now here's my difficulty. Presumptios takes the place of
      Mars, and Presumptios is my father.
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> Then why object to Vulcan?
    
      <h4>PRET.</h4> Because Vulcan is my grandfather.
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> But, my dear, what an objection. You are playing a part
      till the real gods return. That's all.  Whether you are supposed
      to be married to your father—or your grandfather, what does it
      matter? This passion for realism is the curse of the stage.
    
      <h4>PRET.</h4> That's all very well, but I can't throw myself into a part
      that has already lasted a twelvemonth, when I have to make love
      to my father.  It interferes with my conception of the
      characters. It spoils the part.
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> Well, well. I'll see what can be done. [Exit Pretteia,
      L.U.E.) That's always the way with beginners, they've no
      imaginative power.  A true artist ought to be superior to such
      considerations. <p>[Nicemis comes down R.]</p> Well, Nicemis, I should
      say, Diana, what's wrong with you? Don't you like your part?
    
      <h4>NICE.</h4> Oh, immensely. It's great fun.
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> Don't you find it lonely out by yourself all night?
    
      <h4>NICE.</h4> Oh, but I'm not alone all night.
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> But, I don't want to ask any injudicious questions, but who
      accompanies you?
    
      <h4>NICE.</h4> Who? Why Sparkeion, of course.
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> Sparkeion? Well, but Sparkeion is Phoebus Apollo <p>[enter Sparkeion]</p> 
      He's the sun, you know.
    
      <h4>NICE.</h4> Of course he is.  I should catch my death of cold, in the
      night air, if he didn't accompany me.
    
      <h4> SPAR.</h4> My dear Sillimon, it would never do for a young lady to be
      out alone all night. It wouldn't be respectable.
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> There's a good deal of truth in that.  But still—the sun—
      at night—I don't like the idea.  The original Diana always went
      out alone.
    
      <h4>NICE.</h4> I hope the original Diana is no rule for me. After all,
      what does it matter?
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> To be sure—what does it matter?
      <h4>SPAR.</h4> The sun at night, or in the daytime.
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> So that he shines. That's all that's necessary. 
      <p>[Exit Nicemis, R.U.E.]</p> But poor Daphne, what will she say to this.
    
      <h4>SPAR.</h4> Oh, Daphne can console herself; young ladies soon get over
      this sort of thing. Did you never hear of the young lady who was
      engaged to Cousin Robin?
    
      <h4>SILL.</h4> Never.
    
      <h4>SPAR.</h4> Then I'll sing it to you.
    
           <p class="song">Little maid of Arcadee
           Sat on Cousin Robin's knee,
           Thought in form and face and limb,
           Nobody could rival him.
           He was brave and she was fair,
           Truth they made a pretty paid.
           Happy little maiden she—
           Happy maid of Arcadee.
    
           <p>Moments fled as moments will
           Happily enough, until
           After, say, a month or two,
           Robin did as Robins do.
           Weary of his lover's play,
           Jilted her and went away,
           Wretched little maiden, she—
           Wretched maid of Arcadee.
    
           <p>To her little home she crept,
           There she sat her down and wept,
           Maiden wept as maidens will—
           Grew so thin and pale—until
           Cousin Richard came to woo.
           Then again the roses grew.
           Happy little maiden she—
           Happy maid of Arcadee.</p>
