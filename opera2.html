        <div><h3><span>THES.</span></h3> Sillimon, you can retire.

        SILL. Sir, I—
      
        <h3><span>THES.</span></h3> Don't pretend you can't when I say you can. I've seen you
        do it—go. [exit Sillimon bowing extravagantly. Thespis imitates
        him]Well, Mercury, I've been in power one year today.
      
        <h4><mark>MER.</mark></h4> One year today. How do you like ruling the world?
      
        <h3><span>THES.</span></h3> Like it.  Why it's as straightforward as possible. Why
        there hasn't been a hitch of any kind since we came up here. Lor'
        the airs you gods and goddesses give yourselves are perfectly
        sickening. Why it's mere child's play.
      
        <h4><mark>MER.</mark></h4> Very simple isn't it?
      
        <h3><span>THES.</span></h3> Simple? Why I could do it on my head.
      
        MER. Ah—I darsay you will do it on your head very soon.
      
        <h3><span>THES.</span></h3> What do you mean by that, Mercury?
      
        <h4><mark>MER.</mark></h4> I mean that when you've turned the world quite topsy-turvy
        you won't know whether you're standing on your head or your
        heels.
      
        <h3><span>THES.</span></h3> Well, but Mercury, it's all right at present.
      
        <h4><mark>MER.</mark></h4> Oh yes—as far as we know.
      
        <h3><span>THES.</span></h3> Well, but, you know, we know as much as anybody knows; you
        know I believe the world's still going on.
      
        <h4><mark>MER.</mark></h4> Yes—as far as we can judge—much as usual.
      
        <h3><span>THES.</span></h3> Well, the, give the Father of the Drama his due Mercury.
        Don't be envious of the Father of the Drama.
      
        <h4><mark>MER.</mark></h4> But you see you leave so much to accident.
      
        <h3><span>THES.</span></h3> Well, Mercury, if I do, it's my principle. I am an easy
        man, and I like to make things as pleasant as possible. What did
        I do the day we took office?  Why I called the company together
        and I said to them: "Here we are, you know, gods and goddesses,
        no mistake about it, the real thing. Well, we have certain duties
        to discharge, let's discharge them intelligently. Don't let us be
        hampered by routine and red tape and precedent, let's set the
        original gods an example, and put a liberal interpretation on our
        duties.  If it occurs to any one to try an experiment in his own
        department, let him try it, if he fails there's no harm done, if
        he succeeds it is a distinct gain to society. Don't hurry your
        work, do it slowly and well." And here we are after a twelvemonth
        and not a single complaint or a single petition has reached me.
      
        <h4><mark>MER.</mark></h4> No, not yet.
      
        <h3><span>THES.</span></h3> What do you mean by "no,not yet?"
      
        <h4><mark>MER.</mark></h4> Well, you see, you don't understand things. All the
        petitions that are addressed by men to Jupiter pass through my
        hands, and its my duty to collect them and present them once a
        year.
      
        <h3><span>THES.</span></h3> Oh, only once a year?
      
        MER. Only once a year—
      
        <h3><span>THES.</span></h3> And the year is up?
      
        <h4><mark>MER.</mark></h4> Today.
      
        <h3><span>THES.</span></h3> Oh, then I suppose there are some complaints?
      
        <h4><mark>MER.</mark></h4> Yes, there are some.</div>
        <div>                              
             CHORUS

            Hark, the hour of ten is sounding:
            Hearts with anxious fears are bounding,
            Hall of Justice, crowds surrounding,
                 Breathing hope and fear—
            For to-day in this arena,
            Summoned by a stern subpoena,
            Edwin, sued by Angelina,
                 Shortly will appear.

  Enter Usher

                            SOLO - USHER

            Now, Jurymen, hear my advice—
            All kinds of vulgar prejudice
                 I pray you set aside:
            With stern, judicial frame of mind
            From bias free of every kind,
                 This trial must be tried.
